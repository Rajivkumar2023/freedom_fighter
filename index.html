            <img src="image/gandhi.webp" alt="mahatma gandhi"  height="400px" width="100%"><br>The “Father of Nation”, Mahatma Gandhi earned the name because 
            of his great (mahan) deeds like non-violent
             movements. He married Kasturba when he was 13 and studied law in London before travelling to South Africa to practice law. 
             There, he was inspired to fight for human rights by seeing racial discrimination toward some Indians. Gandhi fervently 
             joined the liberation struggle after seeing how India was being ruled by Englishmen. Freedom fighter Mahatma Gandhi led 
             various non-violent protests
             against the British people in his quest for independence, including the "Dandi March" movement, which he took on his bare
              foot to remove the salt tax.</div>

                 a soldier in the British Army, he rebelled when he learned that the cartridges the soldiers were given were lubricated 
                 with pig fat. For the first time, Mangal Pandey inspired Indians by introducing the phrase "Maro Firangi Ko." His
                  uprising served as the catalyst for the first liberation struggle. He was one of the earliest rebels to motivate young
                  Indian soldiers to start the 1857 Great Rebellion, Indian Mutiny, also called India's First War of Independence.</div>

                        finished his studies at Kashi Vidyapeeth, he received the title "Shastri" Scholar. He joined the Mahatma Gandhi-led Salt Satyagraha campaign, the Civil Disobedience movement, and the Quit India movement as a 
                        silent but active liberation warrior. Being an independence freedom fighter he spent a lot of time behind bars. He held the office of Home Minister upon India's independence 
                        before being elected as the second Prime Minister of India in 1964. The most popular phrase “Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan” was coined by him in 1965.</div>

He was born in Punjab in a Sikh family of independence warriors. Since he was a naturalized citizen, he joined the non-Cooperation movement in 1921. To foster patriotism in Punjabi youth, he founded the "Naujawan Bharat Sabha." The Chauri-Chaura Massacre changed him completely. At the age of 23, he was hung to death by British colonizers. His enduring nickname is "Shaheed (martyr) Bhagat Singh." Freedom fighter Bhagat Singh popularized the term "Inquilab Zindabad", and it eventually became the anthem of the Indian independence struggle.

He was a fierce advocate for Mahatma Gandhi. In 1947, Dr. Rajendra Prasad, who served as India's first president from 1950 to 1962, saw his goal come true. He was also among the first Indian presidents to be elected to two consecutive terms. He raised money for Searchlight and Desh during the Independence Movement while also contributing articles to these periodicals. In 1962, Prasad also received the Bharat Ratna, the highest civilian honor.

He became a member of the Indian National Congress and participated in the Civil Disobedience Movement. He sought assistance in Germany after becoming dissatisfied with Gandhi Ji's Non-Violence Method of Freedom and finally founded the Azad Hind Government & Azad Hind Army, now known as Indian National Army (INA), where he trained and supervised all freedom fighters.
